# Handwritten Text Recognizer
Deep Learning Model to recognize and display the handwritten text given by the user.

The system is trained using a CNN model to recognize and differentiate between different characters. The characters are then combined to form the text phrase and is displayed to the user. 


## Built With: ##
* Python
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* OpenCV
* Numpy


## Dataset sources: ##
* For character recognition: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaibhao/handwritten-characters
* For handwritten text recognition: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/landlord/handwriting-recognition

## Procedure: ##
* **Step-1:** Install the datasets on to the Google colab directly from kaggle, unzip it into the drive, this will save a lot of time.
* **Step-2:** Use `!pip install imutils` command to make the basic image processing functions easier.
* **Step-3:**
